# Buzzflow

The real questions NFT owners are wondering everyday: 

* What I can do to push my assets' values? It's minted "common" for all traits.
* Try play-to-earn? The tokens I earned only circulate internally in the project. What if the whole project starts losing impact one day?
* Outside of the system,I have full ownership and the rights of producing variants and peripherals for my NFTs. But how can I market them? What I can make for marketing? The billboards in the Times Square $5k/day? 

**Buzzflow's Answer:**

Yes, the billboards in the Times Square, through your phone camera and in a Tweet, for free.

Plus, instead of the Times Square, if you make it on Himalayas or the North Pole, or rock it on avatar threads to make fire vids, it would be more unique and precious ... 

**All NFTs are minted equal - Just forget the pre-judged "common" tags. Make the buzz, see what's the real "Non-Fungible".**

## Problem Statement
Most NFT projects determine an item's value by 2 factors: (1) the project's own impact (2) the item's inborn (mint-time) trait rarenesses. Owners can bare push their NFTs' value once minted, or when the projects fade down.  **What the owners can do to grow their NFTs' fames and values outside of projects' limited scope?**

## Buzzflow Solution 
(1) Bring your existing NFT **from any blockchain** to Buzzflow on Flow, by verifying your ownership. 
(2) Buzzflow automatically creates 3D/AR variants of this NFT. Chances are:

* If the original NFT only has 2D form, Buzzflow converts them into the textures of expanding collections of 3D objects (paintings, style transferred AI content, clothes printings of standard 3D avatars, billboards, posters, etc. )
* If the original NFT has 3D forms by API (eg. readyplayer.me series), Buzzflow allows direct imports.
* Users can also attach custom 3D variants if they believe related. 

(3) Through Buzzflow's AR mobile app, owners use their own creativities to make 3D/AR videos, and share to social platforms such as Tictok, Instagram and Twitter. With social accounts binded, Buzzflow can provide the trends of its followers, likes and shares **as the dynamic traits**. These dynamic traits will thus impact the NFT's market value.

## Product Thoughts and Benefits
* New concept: Grow-to-earn

* Benefits for Flow blockchain:

  * Users import their NFT series (including famous ones) from other blockchains to Buzzflow to create 3D/AR variants. it can **quickly enrich Flow's ecosystem**. 
  * Buzzflow motivates and incentives owners create and share attractive AR videos to mainstream social platforms (Tictok, IG, Twitter, etc.), granting high marketing exposures for the related NFTs and Flow blockchain itself.
  * By providing high quality 3D/AR NFT variant pipelines and toolchains, Buzzflow can attracts other NFT projects' partnership to Flow blockchain.

* Benefits for NFT owners:

  * NFT owners usually have questions: 

    * What I can do to push my assets' value? It's minted as "common" for all traits.
    * I tried play-to-earn. But the tokens I earned still circulate internally in the project's scope. What if one day the whole project starts losing impact?
    * I have full ownership and the rights of producing variants and peripherals for my NFT. But how can I market it? What I can make for marketing? The billboards of Times square? 

  * Buzzflow's answer: yes, the billboards of Times square, at least through phone cameras. Plus, if you make it on   Himalayas, it's even more precious ... forget the "common" tags. All NFTs are born equal.
